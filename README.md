# blazor-tut
A simple Blazor tutorial to learn how to utilize the technology by building a Flappy Bird Clone. 

This tutorial is isnpired by Erin McLaughlin's Youtube Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy4M_NlMdP7a2TK2PNQioXQ I aim to add to the original 
and learn how to utilize Blazor through this over time. Hoping to take the concept a little further than the simple demo. My goals will be:
<li>Add score system</li>
<li>Add a menu system</li>
<li>Add a high score table</li>
<li>Transition between game states</li>
